            <h1>Hi, I'm Zach Zuber. <br>I like to build things.</h1>

        <h1 class="section-headlines">Why I'm the best person for Basecamp</h1>
        <p>I'm not the best designer. I'm not the best writer. I'm not even the best front end developer. But what I am, is the best person for Basecamp. Why? I love getting shit done. I love rolling up my sleeves, getting my hands dirty, learning, and solving problems.</p>

        <p>Whether it's jumping into a rails app to fix a bug. Walking through a sketch for new page. Or jumping on the phone to talk with a customer, I enjoy tinkering, listening, and observing to find the best solution. The best solution wins, not the biggest ego or loudest voice.</p>

        <p>When it comes to talent some people think you either have or you don't. I say that's bullshit. The only talent you need to succeed is persistence -and not being an asshole helps. The people who put in the work, seek feedback and have fun doing it grow and get rewarded. Most people don't and won't put the work in. That's not me.</p>

       <h1 class="section-headlines">Why I give a damn</h1>

        <p>Six months ago I lost my brother. From September 8 at 9:17am to September 13, I grew more as a person then I had in the previous 22 years of  my life. A couple months after my brother's passing Neal asked me what has changed. At the time I couldn't articulate it, but I can now.</p>

        <p>Everything. My perspective and priorities are focused on what really matters.</p>
        
        <h2 class="section-subtitles">Priorities</h2>
        
        <ul class="personal-section">
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">People</span>, it's what life is all about. My brother knew this. Whether he was at work cracking jokes, hosting dinners or lending a hand when someone needed it, Kyle cared about people. And they cared about him.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Self-sufficiency</span>, I'm not talking about becoming Bear Grylls. But becoming a life long learner and building an arsenal of skills that allow me to live the life I want.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Time</span>, it's limited and our most valuable asset. I want to spend my time on things that matter. With people I like. And have a blast doing it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Happiness</span>, it's a choice. We're all at the same poker table. Only you can choose how to play the hand you're dealt.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-subtitles">Perspective</h2>

        <ul class="personal-section">
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Asking why</span>, most people don't. I do. It provides clarity, opens up communication, builds connections and offers better understanding.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Just do it</span>, no more coulda woulda shouldas. If I want something I go for it. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Keeping it real</span>, I'm honest and make sure expectations are clear and understood.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Be open</span>, I won't let the fear of not understanding keep me from learning and gaining new perspectives.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Reflect</span>, on my choices, conversations and experiences. There is something to learn from everything you do. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>I can talk, but can I walk? Below is a sample of my work. </p>
