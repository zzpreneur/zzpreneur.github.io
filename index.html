        <h1 class="section-headlines">Why I am the best person for Basecamp</h1>
        <p>I'm not the best designer. I'm not the best writer. I'm not even the best front end developer. But I am the best person for Basecamp. Why? I love getting shit done. I love rolling up my sleeves, getting my hands dirty, learning, and solving problems.</p>

        <p>Whether I am jumping into a Rails app to fix a bug, sketching out a new screen, or picking up the phone to talk with a customer, I tinker, listen, and observe to find the best solution. The best solution wins, not the biggest ego or loudest voice.</p>

        <p>Some people think you either have talent or you don't. I say that's bullshit. Hard work and persistence, along with constantly seeking feedback and applying that feedback, develops talent. Most people won't put in the time, I do.</p>

        <p>Details matter, from a bird's-eye view to a magnifying glass inspection. I focus on improving peoples lives by building tools that work. Whether that means sketching out a new idea or testing the text of a button, I make sure all my i's are dotted and t's crossed.</p>

         <p>There is more to a product than code, styling, and copy. Products are tools that give people the capability they need to get a job done. I want to help Basecamp continue to build products that empower people.</p>


        <p>Behind every function written, screen designed, and word type is a person. A great team is a group of people that understand and appreciate each other. Basecamp has a great team and I want to help make it better.</p>

        <p> I believe a great product simplifies peoples lives. Makes people smile. Relates to people. Takes care of people. And gets out of the way. I want to help Basecamp continue to build great products that people care about.</p>

       <h1 class="section-headlines">Why I give a damn</h1>
        <p>Six months ago I lost my brother. From September 8 at 9:17am to September 13, I grew more as a person then I had in the previous 22 years of  my life. A couple months after his passing Neal asked me what has changed. At the time I couldn't articulate it, but I can now.</p>

        <p>Everything. My perspective and priorities are focused on what really matters.</p>

        <ul class="personal-section">
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">People</span>. It's what life is all about. My brother knew this. Whether he was at work cracking jokes, hosting dinners or lending a hand when someone needed it, Kyle cared about people. I do too.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Self-sufficiency</span>. I'm not talking about becoming Bear Grylls. Instead, becoming a life long leaner and building the skills that allow me to live the life I want.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Time</span>. Is limited and our most valuable asset. I want to spend my time on things that matter. With people I respect and like. Life is too short to do work you hate.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Happiness</span>. Is a choice. We are all crowded around the same poker table. Only you can choose how to play the hand you're dealt.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Take action</span>. No excuses. If I want something I go after it. </p>
