        <h1 class="section-headlines">Why I'm the best person for Basecamp</h1>
        <p>I am not the best designer. I am not the best writer. I am not even the best front end developer. But I am the best person for Basecamp. Why? I love getting shit done. I love rolling up my sleeves, getting my hands dirty, learning, and solving problems.</p>

        <p>Whether I am jumping into a Rails app to fix a bug, sketching out a new page, or picking up the phone to talk with a customer, I tinker, listen, and observe my way to find the best solution. The best solution wins, not the biggest ego or loudest voice.</p>

        <p>Some people think you either have talent or you don't. I say that's bullshit. Hard work and peristnece, along with constantly seeking feedback and applying that feedback, develops talent. Most people cannot or will put in the work. I do.</p>

       <h1 class="section-headlines">Why I give a damn</h1>

        <p>Six months ago I lost my brother. From September 8 at 9:17am to September 13, I grew more as a person then I had in the previous 22 years of  my life. A couple months after my brother's passing Neal asked me what has changed. At the time I couldn't articulate it, but I can now.</p>

        <p>Everything. My perspective and priorities are focused on what really matters.</p>
        
        <h2 class="section-subtitles">Priorities</h2>
        
        <ul class="personal-section">
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">People</span>, it's what life is all about. My brother knew this. Whether he was at work cracking jokes, hosting dinners or lending a hand when someone needed it, Kyle cared about people. I do too.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Self-sufficiency</span>, I'm not talking about becoming Bear Grylls. Instead, becoming a life long leaner and building the skills that allow me to me to live the life I want.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Time,</span> is limited and our most valuable asset. I want to spend my time on things that matter. With people I respect and like. Life is too short to do work you hate.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Happiness</span>, it's a choice. We are all crowded around the same poker table. Only you can choose how to play the hand you're dealt.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-subtitles">Perspective</h2>

        <ul class="personal-section">
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Why</span>. Most people don't seek the why. I do. Knowing the why brings clarity, opens up communication, builds connections and leads to a better understanding.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Take action</span>. No excuses. If I want something I go after it. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Keep it real</span>. I'm honest and make sure to communication clearly, making sure expectations are understood.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Being open</span>. I don't let the fear of not understanding keep me from learning and gaining new perspectives.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="highlighted-words">Reflect</span>. On my choices. On my conversations. On my experiences. There is something to learn from everything you do. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>I can talk, but can I walk? Below is a sample of my work. </p>

          <p>I actively seek better ways to solve problems. Whether that means emailing customers with clearly communicated questions to better understand their problems. User testing a page design to see how people actually interact with it. I want to get better at what I do and work on something meaningful that millions of people use. I want to be around people that activley seek to better themsevles. That is why I want to join the Basecamp team.</p>
